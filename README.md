# What does it do?

After you configure your token, you can set how much wpm (words per minute) you want.

10fastfingers has an anti-cheat that request a second verification when you reach 120wps,
this verification is done by an image, instead of the usual text. To bypass that, we use
OCR (Optical character recognition).

# Requirements

- Python and Pip installed.
- A browser with your account logged in (in order to get the token).
- Internet connection.

# How to use

- Download the repository and extract it.
- On `config.json` file, change `CHANGE_TO_YOUR_SESSION` to your session.
- On CMD or terminal, go to the directory where you downloaded the program.
- Type `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
- Then, run the program with the command `python3 type_test.py`.
- If it request for an anti-cheat verification, run `python3 anti_cheat_bypass.py`(the first time will take longer).
